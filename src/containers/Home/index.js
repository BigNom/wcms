            <HR />
            <h1>Perth Markets Wholesale Clearance</h1>
            <p>
              Based in Perth, Australia, we stock a selected range of
              premium quality beef and lamb in whole vacuum packs to
              guarantee tenderness and save the cost of having the meat
              prepared by a butcher. Lower prices are the direct result of
              bulk buying power and less handling. West Coast Meat Solutions
              are open to the public on Saturday morning as part of the
              WholeSale Clearance Market Canning Vale. Meat can be purchased
              in bulk quantities or by the kg at prices you won't see
              anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gates open at 6:00 so make sure you get in early to beat
              the rush.
            </p>

              chains, Super Markets and Butchers all throughout Perth.

            <h1>Buy Bulk Vacuum Packs</h1>
            <p>
              Vacuum packing method involves placing items in a plastic film
              package, removing air from inside, and sealing the package.
              The intent of vacuum packing is usually to remove oxygen from
              the container to extend the shelf life of foods to reduce the
              volume of the contents and package. Vacuum packing reduces
              atmospheric oxygen, limiting the growth of aerobic bacteria or
              fungi, and preventing the evaporation of volatile components.
              Vacuum Packaging assists in the preservation of meat and
              improves tenderness as proteins begin to break down â€“ known as
              the "ageing" process. Enjoy the superb eating quality of aged
              beef.
            </p>
