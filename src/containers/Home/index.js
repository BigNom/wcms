            <h1>Buy Bulk Vacuum Packs</h1>
            <p>
              Vacuum packing method involves placing items in a plastic
              film package, removing air from inside, and sealing the
              package. The intent of vacuum packing is usually to remove
              oxygen from the container to extend the shelf life of foods
              to reduce the volume of the contents and package. Vacuum
              packing reduces atmospheric oxygen, limiting the growth of
              aerobic bacteria or fungi, and preventing the evaporation of
              volatile components. Vacuum Packaging assists in the
              preservation of meat and improves tenderness as proteins
              begin to break down â€“ known as the "ageing" process. Enjoy
              the superb eating quality of aged beef.
