        "description": "The flank is located directly beneath the loin in the abdominal area. The flank steak is extremely versatile. Relatively long and flat, it has a coarse grain running along its length which adds another dimension to its appeal and application. Perfect for thin slicing for a stir-fry, flank steak also performs extremely well under slow-cooking conditions. After slow-cooking this beef cut can be shredded with a fork and added to burritos or salads."
